# HISTORY

These tools are based on the function ``SearchDepend`` that Yves Bertot posted
on ``Coq-Club`` at on the February 27th, 2009.

I first tried to generate a graph directly from COQ, but it becomes rapidly huge
and difficult to use. It appears that we need a tool to be able to filter what
we really want to see.
So finally, I have made a simple file generation from coq to export every useful
information. The idea is to have external tools to read the information file and
generate whatever we want.  I think it will be easier to maintain and extend.
